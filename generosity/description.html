                        Compassion is necessary, but it is not enough. It is a stimulus to help, but the resulting action is generosity. The practices of generosity are so important that in many world religions they are formalized and even considered mandatory. Buddhism recommends three forms of generosity: material offerings, liberation from fear, and spiritual offerings. This regular care for others gives us the most joy.          
                        <p class="text-justify practice-description">
                            <span class="font-weight-bold">1. Material donations.</span> There is no substitute for helping to overcome the inequalities and injustices that still exist in our world. By sacrificing a tithe or even a tribute, you are actually starting to think weekly and even daily about what you can share with others. On the example of our application, you can make a donut or watch advertising, thus helping the further development of the application and the spiritual development of users.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify practice-description">
                            <span class="font-weight-bold">2. Exemption from fear.</span> You can include protection, advice and comfort. So we can share our time and attention with others. Who needs our presence today? Do your children, spouse, parents, friends, colleagues need your compassion and care today? Who can you support?
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify practice-description">
                            <span class="font-weight-bold">3. Spiritual donations.</span> You don't have to be a spiritual teacher to make this kind of sacrifice. Spiritual offerings can include passing on wisdom and knowledge to those who need it, as well as showing generosity that helps others be happier. You can significantly change the quality of human communication in your community by simply smiling at passersby. This communication has the strongest impact on the quality of human life in our time, when the world's population is becoming larger and more lonely, and poverty still coexists with wealth.
